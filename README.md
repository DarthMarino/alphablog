This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that tries to emulate how blogs work nowadays. (inspired in Medium and Dev.to)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the homepage.

You will find the feed page, where you will find posts sorted by rating.

The page uses a [slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Slug) based url where the routes are more friendly to users.

Absolute path is configured for the styles, components and libs.
